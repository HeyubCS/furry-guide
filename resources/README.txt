I think this is a good start for the tiles. The basic design and creation in godot wasn't that hard but getting the art right would take some time. We can also determine what other tiles we might need.

Currently has 
*Flat
*Block
*Endcaps with their own Blocks
*Large and Small Slopes for both directions. (need both large and small at a minimum)

Known Bugs:
-Blocks placed beside the large slope blocks don't look good and will actually block movement.
-A few different graphical glitches with a couple of the tiles

Known Issues:
-The main block does not tile well.
