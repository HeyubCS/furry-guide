The end goal is to create a fundamental platformer with light action and rpg elements.
In the short term this is our goal:

This game will consist of three regions. Each region will have three scenes. The final scene of the region will have a boss fight.
Each region will have at least two enemies and two types of traps, as well as a boss. At the end of each boss fight a new feature will be unlocked for the player to use.
